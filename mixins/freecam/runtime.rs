// Horizon Freecam: control your camera separately from your player, ported
// from the Freecam mod (https://github.com/MinecraftFreecam/Freecam, MIT).
//
// The toggle key detaches the camera at the player's eye; the movement keys
// then fly it through blocks (no-clip, the original's default), and disabling
// returns the view to the player. F4 plus a hotbar digit opens one of nine
// tripod cameras whose positions are kept until reset. The state machine,
// movement, settings and messages live here; the helper files bridge this
// module to the game (keys, the camera view, the HUD). This file is both the
// mod's Cargo library (its tests) and the module the bundle adds to the game.
//
// Settings are kept as the original's config was (`horizon-mods/
// .horizon-mod-data/freecam/<key>`), with the original's defaults:
// static-velocity flight at one block a tick, no-clip, the inside perspective,
// the player shown, exiting on damage, no interaction, notifications on.
//
// The original's collision modes past `ignoreAll` (transparent, openable,
// custom lists), the hand, submersion fog, the outline, "control player",
// full brightness and server restrictions are not ported yet; see README.md.
